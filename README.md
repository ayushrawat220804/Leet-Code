# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! üöÄ  
This repository is automatically updated with my solved LeetCode problems, organized in the following structure:
- **(problem_number, problem_name).cpp**: Contains my solution to the problem with comments on time and space complexity.
- **README.md**: Includes the full problem statement from LeetCode.
- **notes.md**: An empty file for future notes or additional thoughts (created automatically).

## How It Works
This repository is maintained using **LeetHub**, a simple Chrome extension that automates the process of pushing solved LeetCode problems to GitHub. It automatically creates the files mentioned above and comments my code with time and space complexity.

### üõ†Ô∏è [Check out the LeetHub extension here](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub)

## Thank You
A big shoutout to the developer of LeetHub for building such an awesome tool! It makes tracking and sharing my progress seamless. üôå
